# 2048-in-Csharp

First program in C# : creating a game for a highschool project. I decided to recreate a popular game at that time: 2048. I coded this in 2015 and the only experience I had beforehand was in C++. There's a working executable too so have fun playing(use arrows for moving the tiles)! Here's a snap of the game:
